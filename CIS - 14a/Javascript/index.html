				<h3>UPDATE 1:</h3>
			<p>
				
				Hello there and welcome to my home page I would like you to look around<br> 
				anywhere you'd like there are assignments everywhere for you to see the<br> 
				site will be continuously updated throughout this week and I hope to finish it very soon!<br>
			</p>
				<h3>UPDATE 2:</h3>
			<p>
				I am highly thinking about getting rid of my side image due to the fact that it doesn't<br>
				go with the current color scheme if anyone could give me any suggestions just email me about it<br>
			</p>
				<h3>UPDATE 3:</h3>
			<p>
				I am going to be putting up my current project that will be a game. It will be the game called master mind<br>
				I am hoping that you will all enjoy it while I get it up and running if there's any bugs with it please notify<br>
				me asap!<br>
			</p>
				<h3>UPDATE 4:</h3>
			<p>
				I am currently implementing CSS in the website there will be a different look about it and the color scheme<br>
				will be slightly different. I hope you all enjoy the new look that I will be putting up<br>
			</p>
				<h3>UPDATE 5:</h3>
			<p>
				I will be putting up the random generator for the colors as of this week I will also link to the original<br>
				look of the website if anyone wants to see what it originally looked like for idea sharing :)
